MISSING FILES ON GITHUB - YOU NEED TO PUSH THESE:

CSS FILES (CRITICAL):
- community-premium.css
- auth-styles.css

JAVASCRIPT FILES (CRITICAL):
- community-functions.js
- community-live-updates.js
- dashboard.js
- auth.js

HTML FILES:
- dashboard.html
- auth.html
- topic-view.html

UPDATED FILE:
- script.js (I updated this with the window.user fix)

HOW TO PUSH:
1. git add community-premium.css auth-styles.css community-functions.js community-live-updates.js dashboard.js auth.js dashboard.html auth.html topic-view.html script.js
2. git commit -m "Add community hub CSS and JS files"
3. git push

The Index.html is already on GitHub but it's trying to load files that aren't there.
That's why you see unstyled content - the CSS files are missing from the repo.
